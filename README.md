# Tetris-Game2
A recreation of the classic game Tetris.

This program will allow users to play one of the original versions of the Tetris game.
>In Further Detail: The program is a game that simulates tiles of different shapes that must be sorted/organized to create full row, which then destroys the row and allow the user to continue round/game until they fail to create a row. The longer the user can keep the tiles from reaching the top the more points they will earn.
